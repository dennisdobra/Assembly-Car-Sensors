# Car Sensors Project

## Overview

The "Car Sensors" project focuses on the implementation of various sensors for enhancing the functionality and performance of vehicles. The project is divided into three main parts, each addressing different aspects of sensor technology and its application in modern cars.

## Project Structure

- **Part 1**: **Basic Sensor Implementation**  
  This part covers the foundational concepts of sensor technology, including the implementation of basic sensor functionalities such as temperature and pressure sensing. It focuses on data acquisition and preliminary processing techniques to ensure accurate readings.

- **Part 2**: **Advanced Sensor Integration**  
  In this part, advanced sensors like accelerometers and gyroscopes are integrated into the system. The focus is on developing algorithms for sensor fusion, which combines data from multiple sensors to provide more accurate and reliable information about the vehicle's state and environment.

- **Part 3**: **Real-time Sensor Processing (In Progress)**  
  The final part aims to implement real-time processing of sensor data for applications like collision detection and lane-keeping assistance. This part is currently under development and will incorporate machine learning techniques for predictive analysis based on sensor inputs.
